/**
 * A TranslogSequencer allows multiple producers of [Translog.Operation]s to write them in sequence number order to an
 * index.  It internally uses an [actor] to serialize writes to the index. Producer can call the [send] method
 * to add a batch of operations to the queue.  If the queue is full the producer will be suspended.  Operations can be
 * sent out of order i.e. the operation with sequence number 2 can be sent before the operation with sequence number 1.
 * In this case the Sequencer will internally buffer the operations that cannot be delivered until the missing in-order
 * operations arrive.
 *
 * This uses the ObsoleteCoroutinesApi actor API.  As described in the [actor] docs there is no current replacement for
 * this API and a new one is being worked on to which we can migrate when needed.
