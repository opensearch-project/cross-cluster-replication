Cross-Cluster Replication Plugin enables users to replicate data across two opensearch clusters which enables a number of use cases such as 

- **Disaster Recovery (DR) or High Availability (HA):** For production systems with high availability requirements, cross-cluster replication provides the safety-net of being able to failover to an alternate cluster in case of failure or outages on the primary cluster.
- **Reduced Query Latency:** For critical business needs, responding to the customer query in the shortest time is critical. Replicating data to a cluster that is closest to the user can drastically reduce the query latency. Applications can redirect the customer query to the nearest data center where data has been replicated.
- **Scaling out query heavy workloads:** Splitting a query heavy workload across multiple replica clusters improves  horizontal scalability.
- **Aggregated reports** - Enterprise customers can roll up reports continually from smaller clusters belonging to different lines of business into a central cluster for consolidated reports, dashboards or visualizations.

Following are the tenets that guided our design:

- **Secure**: Cross-cluster replication should offer strong security controls for all flows and APIs.
- **Correctness**: There must be no difference between the intended contents of the follower index and the leader index.
- **Performance**: Replication should not impact indexing rate of the leader cluster. 
- **Lag**: The replication lag between the leader and the follower cluster should be under a few seconds.
- **Resource usage**: Replication should use minimal resources. 


The replication machinery is implemented as an OpenSearch plugin that exposes APIs to control replication, spawns background persistent tasks to asynchronously replicate indices and utilizes snapshot repository abstraction to facilitate bootstrap. Replication relies on cross cluster connection setup from the follower cluster to the leader cluster for connectivity. Once replication is initiated on an index, a background persistent task per primary shard on the follower cluster continuously polls corresponding shards from the leader index and applies the changes on to the follower shard. The replication plugin offers seamless integration with the OpenSearch Security plugin for secure data transfer and access control.


## Build

The project in this package uses the [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) build system. Gradle comes with excellent documentation that should be your first stop when trying to figure out how to operate or modify the build.

### Building from the command line
Set JAVA_HOME to JDK-11 or above  

1. `./gradlew build` builds and tests project.
2. `./gradlew clean release` cleans previous builds, creates new build and tests project.
3. `./gradlew clean run -PnumNodes=3` launches a 3 node cluster of both leader and follower with replication plugin installed.
4. `./gradlew integTest` launches a single node cluster's and runs all integ tests.
5. `./gradlew integTest -Dtests.class=*{class-name}` runs a single integ class.
6.  `./gradlew integTest -Dtests.class=*{class-name} -Dtests.method="{method-name}"` runs a single integ test method (remember to quote the test method name if it contains spaces).

## Intellij Setup

Launch Intellij IDEA, choose **Import Project**, and select the `settings.gradle` file in the root of this package.

## Getting Started

Following steps will help you install the replication plugin on a test cluster.

### Step 1: Start test clusters with replication plugin locally

```bash
./gradlew clean run -PnumNodes=3


# Set variables for readability (in different terminal window/tab where you will run rest of the steps)
export LEADER=localhost:9200
export FOLLOWER=localhost:9201
export LEADER_TRANSPORT=localhost:9300
```

### Step 2: Setup cross-cluster connectivity

Setup remote cluster connection from follower cluster to the leader cluster

```bash
curl -XPUT "http://${FOLLOWER}/_cluster/settings?pretty" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d"
{
  \"persistent\": {
    \"cluster\": {
      \"remote\": {
        \"leader-cluster\": {
          \"seeds\": [ \"${LEADER_TRANSPORT}\" ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
"
```

### Step 3: Populate leader cluster with sample data

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://${LEADER}/leader-01/_doc/1" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"value" : "data1"}'
```

### Step 4: Start replication

```bash
curl -XPUT "http://${FOLLOWER}/_plugins/_replication/follower-01/_start?pretty" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-d'{"leader_alias":"leader-cluster", "leader_index": "leader-01"}'
```

### Step 5: Make changes to data on leader index

```bash
# 1. Modify doc with id 1
curl -XPOST "http://${LEADER}/leader-01/_doc/1" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"value" : "data1-modified"}'

# 2. Add doc with id 2
curl -XPOST "http://${LEADER}/leader-01/_doc/2" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"value" : "data2"}'
```

### Step 6: Validate replicated content on the follower

```bash
# 1. Validate replicated index exists
curl -XGET "http://${FOLLOWER}/_cat/indices"
# The above should list "follower-01" as on of the index as well

# 2. Check content of follower-01
curl -XGET "http://${FOLLOWER}/follower-01/_search"
# The above should list 2 documents with id 1 and 2 and matching content of
# leader-01 index on $LEADER cluster

```

At this point, any changes to leader-01 continues to be replicated to follower-01.

### Step 7: Stop replication

Stopping replication opens up the replicated index on the follower cluster for writes. This can be leveraged to failover to the follower cluster when the need arises.

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://${FOLLOWER}/_plugins/_replication/follower-01/_stop?pretty" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' -d'{}'

# You can confirm data isn't replicated any more by making modifications to
# leader-01 index on $LEADER cluster 
```
